{"name":"Cellnetr","tagline":"CellNet: network biology-based computational platform to assess establishment of cell type specific gene regulatory networks in user-provided gene expression profiles","body":"### CellNet: source code\r\n\r\n<b>CellNet</b> is a network biology-based computational platform that more accurately assesses the fidelity of cellular engineering than existing methodologies and generates hypotheses for improving cell derivations. CellNet is based on the reconstruction of cell type specific gene regulatory networks (GRNs), which we performed using publicly available microarray data on 21 cell and tissue types from both human and mouse samples. Code to run CellNet locally is available for download on this site. You can also analyze your data through our <a href='http://cellnet.hms.harvard.edu'>our servers</a>, where you can also explore predicted transcriptional targets of over 1,200 mouse or human transcriptional regulators.\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\nCellNet was written in <a href='http://www.r-project.org/'>R</a>. List prerequisites.\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\nDirections to install locally.\r\n\r\n### Running CellNet\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Interpreting results\r\n\r\n### Adding a cell or tissue type\r\n\r\n### Adding a new platform\r\n\r\n### Adding a new species\r\n\r\n### Reconstructing GRNs\r\n\r\n### Identifying cell and tissue specific sub-networks\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects.
