{"name":"Cellnetr","tagline":"CellNet: network biology-based computational platform to assess establishment of cell type specific gene regulatory networks in user-provided gene expression profiles","body":"### CellNet: source code\r\n\r\n<b>CellNet</b> is a network biology-based computational platform that more accurately assesses the fidelity of cellular engineering than existing methodologies and generates hypotheses for improving cell derivations. CellNet is based on the reconstruction of cell type specific gene regulatory networks (GRNs), which we performed using publicly available microarray data on 21 cell and tissue types from both human and mouse samples. Code to run CellNet locally is available for download on this site. You can also analyze your data through our <a href='http://cellnet.hms.harvard.edu'>our servers</a>, where you can also explore predicted transcriptional targets of over 1,200 mouse or human transcriptional regulators.\r\n\r\nCellNet was written by Patrick Cahan with input from Hu Li, Samantha Morris, and Edroaldo Lummertz da Rocha.\r\n\r\nIt is provided under the OSI-approved Artistic License (version 2.0).\r\n\r\n### Release 0.1 -- 08-14-2014\r\n\r\nThe first version of CellNet is now available. This software a beta release, meaning that it is a work in progress, and new features will be added in the near future. To report a bugs or to discuss this software (but not the web application, please), go to the <a href='https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cellnet_r'>CellNet user group</a>.\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\nCellNet was written in <a href='http://www.r-project.org/'>R</a>.
